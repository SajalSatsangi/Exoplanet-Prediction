# Exo-Planet Predictor

## Overview

Exo-Planet Predictor is a web-based application that utilizes a robust machine learning model to predict the habitability of exoplanets. The project encompasses both the frontend development and the integration of a sophisticated predictive model based on diverse planetary features.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model:** The core of the project is a powerful machine learning model that analyzes various features, including mass, radius, and orbital characteristics, to predict the habitability of exoplanets.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The frontend of the website is designed to provide users with an intuitive experience. It allows users to easily input relevant data and receive predictions about the potential habitability of exoplanets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (for running the backend machine learning model)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for managing frontend dependencies)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/exo-planet-predictor.git
   cd exo-planet-predictor
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the backend server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory and start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the Exo-Planet Predictor web application.
